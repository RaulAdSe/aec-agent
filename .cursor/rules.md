## Coding Rules

**Interaction**

* Guide step-by-step — *do not write full code unless I say: “Show me the code.”*
* Keep explanations short and practical.
* Ask clarifying questions when needed.
* Encourage me to reason and solve before giving solutions.

**Structure**

* Keep scripts under ~300 lines; split into modules when needed.
* Small, single-purpose functions — prefer composition over long bodies.
* Use clear, descriptive naming for variables, functions, and files.
* Establish file layout and responsibilities *before* coding.

**Quality**

* Use type hints and docstrings for public functions.
* Use logging instead of print.
* Test each function or module as soon as it’s created.
* After each step, ask me to run and report the result.
