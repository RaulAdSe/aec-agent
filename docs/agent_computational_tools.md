```

**Agent Applications**:
- Validate travel distances
- Check evacuation accessibility
- Identify compliance issues

## Advanced Analysis Capabilities

### Spatial Relationship Analysis

The tools can analyze complex spatial relationships including:

- **Room Adjacency**: Which rooms are physically connected
- **Circulation Patterns**: How people move through the building
- **Critical Paths**: Essential routes for evacuation
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Points of circulation congestion

### Compliance Validation

Built-in compliance checking against common regulations:

- **Evacuation Distances**: 25m protected, 35m unprotected routes
- **Door Widths**: 800mm minimum, 900mm for emergency exits
- **Accessibility**: Clear width and accessible route requirements
- **Occupancy Loads**: Based on room use and area

### Performance Metrics

Comprehensive building performance assessment:

- **Safety Grade**: A-D rating based on evacuation compliance
- **Circulation Grade**: A-C rating based on connectivity
- **Door Grade**: A-D rating based on door compliance
- **Overall Score**: 0-100 building performance score

## Integration with Agent System

### Tool Discovery

All tools are automatically registered with the agent system and can be discovered via:

```python
tools = get_available_tools()
for tool in tools:
    print(f"{tool['name']}: {tool['description']}")
```

### Error Handling

All tools include robust error handling and return structured error information:

```python
result = some_tool()
if 'error' in result:
    print(f"Tool failed: {result['error']}")
else:
    # Process successful result
    pass
```

### Data Requirements

Tools require building data to be loaded first:

```python
# Load project data first
load_project_data("path/to/building/data.json")

# Then use analysis tools
result = analyze_building_circulation()
```

## Usage Patterns for Autonomous Operation

### 1. Building Assessment Workflow

```python
# 1. Load and validate data
load_project_data()

# 2. Assess overall circulation
circulation = analyze_building_circulation()

# 3. Check evacuation compliance
evacuation = find_all_evacuation_routes_tool()

# 4. Analyze door compliance
doors = analyze_door_compliance_comprehensive()

# 5. Generate comprehensive report
# Combine results for final assessment
```

### 2. Room-Specific Analysis

```python
# For each room of interest
for room_id in important_rooms:
    connectivity = check_room_connectivity(room_id)
    occupancy = calculate_occupancy_load(room_id)
    egress = calculate_egress_distance(room_id)
    
    # Assess room performance
    # Generate recommendations
```

### 3. Compliance Verification

```python
# Check all compliance aspects
door_compliance = analyze_door_compliance_comprehensive()
evacuation_compliance = find_all_evacuation_routes_tool()
circulation_health = analyze_building_circulation()

# Generate compliance report
overall_compliance = calculate_overall_score(
    door_compliance, evacuation_compliance, circulation_health
)
```

## Best Practices for Agent Use

### 1. Always Validate Data First
- Check that building data is loaded
- Verify data completeness
- Handle missing or incomplete data gracefully

### 2. Use Comprehensive Analysis
- Don't rely on single metrics
- Combine multiple tool outputs
- Cross-validate results

### 3. Provide Context in Responses
- Explain what the metrics mean
- Reference regulatory requirements
- Suggest specific improvements

### 4. Handle Edge Cases
- Empty buildings or levels
- Disconnected building sections
- Missing door or room connections

## Example Agent Response Pattern

```python
def analyze_building_safety(building_id):
    \"\"\"Example of how agent might use tools comprehensively.\"\"\"
    
    # Load building data
    if not load_project_data(building_id):
        return "Unable to load building data"
    
    # Comprehensive analysis
    circulation = analyze_building_circulation()
    evacuation = find_all_evacuation_routes_tool()
    doors = analyze_door_compliance_comprehensive()
    
    # Generate structured response
    response = f\"\"\"
    Building Safety Analysis for {building_id}:
    
    ðŸ”— Circulation: {circulation['analysis_summary']['overall_circulation_health']}
    - Critical rooms: {circulation['critical_circulation_points']['critical_room_count']}
    
    ðŸš¨ Evacuation: {evacuation['compliance_summary']['compliance_rate']:.1%} compliant
    - Average distance: {evacuation['average_distance']:.1f}m
    
    ðŸšª Doors: {doors['overall_compliance_rate']:.1%} compliant
    - Non-compliant: {len(doors['width_compliance']['non_compliant'])} doors
    
    Overall Status: {"GOOD" if all_metrics_good else "NEEDS ATTENTION"}
    \"\"\"
    
    return response
```

This comprehensive tool suite enables the agent to perform sophisticated building analysis autonomously, providing detailed insights and recommendations for compliance verification and building performance optimization.
