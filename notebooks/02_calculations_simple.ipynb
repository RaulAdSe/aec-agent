    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we've learned how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîß **Geometric Calculations**\n",
    "- Calculate room areas and perimeters using the Shapely library\n",
    "- Find room centroids and bounding boxes\n",
    "- Analyze spatial relationships between rooms\n",
    "\n",
    "### üï∏Ô∏è **Graph-Based Analysis**\n",
    "- Create circulation graphs from building data\n",
    "- Analyze building connectivity and identify critical paths\n",
    "- Find articulation points that are crucial for circulation\n",
    "\n",
    "### üö® **Evacuation Planning**\n",
    "- Calculate shortest evacuation routes from each room\n",
    "- Analyze evacuation distances for compliance\n",
    "- Visualize circulation patterns and critical routes\n",
    "\n",
    "### üî• **Fire Safety Analysis**\n",
    "- Assess fire equipment coverage across the building\n",
    "- Identify areas lacking adequate protection\n",
    "- Calculate equipment effectiveness and placement\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìä **Compliance Assessment**\n",
    "- Generate comprehensive compliance reports\n",
    "- Score buildings against regulatory requirements\n",
    "- Provide actionable recommendations for improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automation is Key**: These calculations would be tedious by hand but are instant with code\n",
    "2. **Visual Analysis**: Graphs and floor plans reveal patterns not obvious in raw data\n",
    "3. **Compliance Checking**: Systematic analysis ensures nothing is missed\n",
    "4. **Optimization Opportunities**: Analysis reveals where improvements can be made\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "With these calculation tools, you can:\n",
    "- Analyze your own building projects\n",
    "- Customize compliance criteria for different regulations\n",
    "- Integrate with CAD software for automated analysis\n",
    "- Develop specialized tools for specific building types\n",
