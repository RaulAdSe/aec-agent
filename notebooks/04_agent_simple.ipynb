      "### Insights and Recommendations:\n",
      "- The analyzed door (D3283) meets the minimum width requirement, ensuring compliance with regulations.\n",
      "- The circulation graph analysis indicates that not all rooms are connected, which could impact the building's accessibility and safety.\n",
      "- Further analysis and adjustments may be needed to improve room connectivity and ensure efficient circulation within the building.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on these findings, it is crucial to address the room connectivity issue to enhance the building's functionality and compliance with safety standards. Further investigations and adjustments may be necessary to optimize the circulation paths within the building.\n",
